    "text": "Retoweb adds additional functionality to control the header of the website (thus, webheader). Two different types are available: image or carousel. When set, this will overrule quartos title blocks.\nThe index page of the template shows a series of variations for type: carousel. The webheader can be defined in the yml header of the individual .qmd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\n\nNote that the images must be located in header-images/ (or any other folder defined as resources in _quarto.yml).\n\n\nExample 1: A simple rotating header with two images without additional image options specified. The interval time for auto rotation is set to 2 seconds.\nwebheader:\n    type: carousel\n    options:\n        interval: 2000\n    images:\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-1.jpg\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-2.jpg\nExample 2: Rotating carousel-type header with two images, whereof the first makes use of all available image options. The second solely includes an alternative text which is included in the HTML but does not change the appearance.\nwebheader:\n    type: carousel\n    options:\n        interval: 2000\n    images:\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-1.jpg\n          title: \"Image number one.\"\n          description: \"Full header with icon, title, description, and background color.\"\n          alt: Page header showing the websites logo on top of an artistic blueish background.\n          bg: \"rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)\"\n          icon: assets/logo-rotorweb-white.svg\n\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-2.jpg\n          alt: Page header image for design purposes.\nExample 3: Static header image. As only one image is provided, the page will always show the image as defined.\nwebheader:\n    type: image\n    images:\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-1.jpg\nExample 4: Static but random header image. Each time the page is loaded one (randomly selected) image among the ones defined will be displayed. The [about][about.qmd] page shows how this looks like.\nwebheader:\n    type: image\n    images:\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-1.jpg\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-2.jpg\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-3.jpg\n        - image: header-images/unsplash-4.jpg\n\n\nThe two types available are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ncarousel\nseries of rotating images. Allows for additional styling (see [below])\n\n\nimage\nsingle or random image (static)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefined under options. For now, only the interval (for automated carousel rotation) can be defined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ninterval\nPositive integer, rotation-interval in milliseconds. Defaults to 4000 if not specified.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following options are available to define an image. All besides image are optional and affect the way the image(s) are displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOption\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nimage\nName/path of the header image. If not specified it will simply be ignored.\n\n\ntitle\nTitle to be displayed.\n\n\ndescription\nDescription to be displayed.\n\n\nalt\nAlternative information added to the image.\n\n\nbg\nBackground color, any valid css definition (e.g., red, #fff, rgba(100, 100, 100, 0.3)).\n\n\nicon\nName/path of an icon/image to be displayed on top of the header image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures for type: image\n\n\n\nDoes not yet provide the optional arguments like title, description, alt, bg, or icon but will be added (TODO(R))."

One of the features missing were the ‘rotating header images’, one of the main reasons for the name Rotorweb.\nIn addition, R is the first letter of the first name of the authors and one of his preferred programming languages: R.\nQuarto helps to ‘lift’ and raise dynamic documents to the next level using quarto to create websites, presentations, exercises and documents using R, Python and Julia."
