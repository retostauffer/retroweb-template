## jQuery support

The {{< var theme.name >}} theme adds [jQuery]({{< var links.jquery >}}) support.
To avoid cross-site loading - which would require user consent due to the European GDPR - a
'frozen' version of jQuery is shipped with the
[{{< var theme.name >}}]({{< var links.rotorweb-ext >}}) extension.
Currently jQuery `3.6.0` is included
(see [package.json](https://github.com/retostauffer/rotorweb-ext/blob/main/package.json)).
